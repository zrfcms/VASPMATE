>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>   ADD POTCAR PATH  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The only external path setting that VASPMATE relies on is the pseudopotential storage location, 
which corresponds to the command VASPMATE --pot. The POTCAR in the examples we offered are all 
generated by this way. 
!!!!
Creates a file named .potpath in the ~/ directory and enters the path to the pseudopotential 
library in the following format (case sensitive).
PBE_PATH = ~/POTPBE54
LDA_PATH = ~/POTPBE54
GGA_PATH = ~/POTPBE54
!!!
More details refer to docs/VASPMATE-manual.docx.
